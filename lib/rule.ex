  Implements a request throttling algorithm.

  The `key` differentiates different throttles, you can use, for example,
  `conn.remote_ip` for per IP throttling, or an email address for login attempts
  limitation. If the `key` is falsey the throttling is not performed and
  next rules are evaluated.

  Be careful not to use the same `key` for different rules that use the same
  storage.

  Passes `{:throttle, data}`, as the data to both allow and block tuples, where
  data is a keyword containing: `:period`, `:limit`, `:expires_at` - when the
  current limit will expire as unix time in milliseconds,
  and `:remaining` - the remaining limit. This can be useful for adding
  "X-RateLimit-*" headers.

  ## Options

    * `:storage` - required, a tuple of `PlugAttack.Storage` implementation
      and storage options.
    * `:limit` - required, how many requests in a period are allowed.
    * `:period` - required, how long, in ms, is the period.

  Implements an algorithm inspired by fail2ban.

  This intends to catch misbehaving clients early and for longer amounts of
  time. The `key` differentiates different clients, you can use, for example,
  `conn.remote_ip` for per IP tracking. If the `key` is falsey the action is
  skipped and next rules are evaluated.

  Be careful not to use the same `key` for different rules that use the same
  storage.

  Passes `{:fail2ban, key, remaining_ban}`, as the data to `block_action` calls when an
  abusive request is detected. Each misbehaving client is blocked after each
  call and tracked for `:period` time. If more than `:limit` abusive requests
  are detected within the `:period`, the client is banned for `:ban_for`.

  ## Options

    * `:storage` - required, a tuple of `PlugAttack.Storage` implementation
      and storage options.
    * `:period` - required, how long to store abusive requests for counting
      towards `:limit` exhaustion.
    * `:limit` - required, max abusive requests allowed before the ban.
    * `:ban_for` - required, length of the ban in milliseconds.
